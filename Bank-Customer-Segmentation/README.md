üè¶ Bank-Customer-Segmentation
> Building a classification model for grouping bank customers, based on similar patterns
## ‚ùì  Goal of this Project:
> - #### 1. Perform Clustering/Segmentation:
 Utilize the dataset to perform clustering or segmentation, identifying popular customer groups with their distinct definitions or rules.
> - #### 2. Conduct Location-wise Analysis:
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer transactions to uncover interesting trends that can be harnessed by the bank to enhance and optimize user experiences.
> - #### 3.Customer Recency, Frequency, Monetary Analysis:
Assess customer behavior using recency, frequency, and monetary analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer engagement and financial activity.
> - #### 4.  Network or Graph Analysis:
Apply network or graph analysis techniques to the customer data, facilitating the discovery of valuable insights and relationships among customers.
